## <a name='stronger'></a> ...Makes You Stronger

We've become a culture averse to adversity. From "no-losers" sports to "safe spaces" on campuses we make a conscious effort to avoid the pain that comes from defeat or hard-to-hear differences of philosophy and outlook. We take this same avoidance in to far more painful aspects of our own personal lives as well. Through this fear of confronting hard things we've lost sight that our humanity shines no brighter than when we push through struggles large and small.

Our muscles and endurance only grow when we push well in to discomfort and often outright pain. Our minds, psyches, and spirts need the same hard work as well. After all, what doesn't kill you...

## <a name='better_quality'></a>More Better Quality Coverage


How do you ensure your feature's well-built and does what the customer needs (which may be different than what they want)? How do you ensure the feature's high quality? When do you discuss things like test case construction? Test data creation? Performance needs? And let's just skip by security because that's scary.

In this session we'll walk through creating a critical business feature. We'll take the journey all the way from ideation through production monitoring. You'll learn where to have various conversations about quality, and what you might consider along the way.

You'll see examples of good conversations used to help business focus on high-value features. You'll also help build out solid acceptance criteria, and you'll learn where to tie those pesky "Non-functional requirements" in. We'll tie all this together with working tests and code--and you'll see how exploratory testing fits in along the entire journey.

Make sure you're getting the best quality coverage of your work!


## <a name='beyond_basics'></a> Automated Testing: Beyond The Basics

You've been through some initial training or bootstrapping. Now you're three to six months down the road and you're finding a lot of time is being spent chasing intermittent test failures. You're spending a lot of time maintaining your codebase. You're spending a lot of time dealing with frustration and trust in the automated tests. What's you're not doing is adding a lot of value around new feature work.

Sound familiar? It's a pattern that's common across nearly every team that is new to building significant automation suites. Jim Holmes helps you find a few approaches that may save your sanity&mdash;all based on years of experience and hard knocks. 

This isn't a WebDriver 101 session; we won't be covering basics like waits, find logic, or basic page objects. Instead, we'll dive in to solving problems using software craftsmanship principles, custom-designed APIs, and approaches like Selenium Grid to help you scale out your test suites via parallel execution. You'll leave the session with practical tips to apply to your own testing.

## <a name='growing_testing'></a> Growing a Testing^H^H^H^H^H^H^HWhole Team Organization The Hard Way

Organizational change doesn't come easy. We humans are tetchy beings who often aren't comfortable getting out of the comfy ruts we let ourselves get in.

Join Jim Holmes for an experience report on how he helped a couple organizations change how they tested and delivered software. You'll learn some critical techniques for helping drive change around testing: Getting buy-in from executives and management. Hiring/staffing the right people. Helping existing team members learn to adapt--and dealing with those that won't. 

You'll also learn why testing tools and test cases do NOT solve any quality issues, and you'll also hear plenty of lessons-learned and hard knocks.

Stovepiped testing should have gone down with the Titanic. Learn how to help your organization get quality across your entire delivery team, not just the people you blame for not "Assuring Quality."

> Tweaked for StarWest
> Testing as an "event" after developers have finished their work can't "assure" quality at all. Teams that follow stove-piped processes are losing out on tremendous potential for true, honest collaboration that can seriously transform how they deliver value to their customers. This talk walks attendees through real-life situations where teams and organizations fundamentally changed their approaches to delivering high-quality software. Specific examples tie to concrete tips and approaches to helping integrate testing as an ongoing activity across the entire lifecycle&mdash;not just a late-occurring event.



## <a name='growing_leadership'></a> Growing Into Leadership

Too many of our organizations across society have poor leadership. It doesn't matter if we're talking about the military, private sector firms, or the local Cub Scout pack. Great leaders help us get the most out of our teams and ourselves, not just at the high meta level, but during each day's grind.

In this session we'll talk about why you might consider stepping up into a leadership role (or evolving one you're currently in), and what things about yourself you can leverage and improve upon. It's also important to understand routes you can take to leadership. Most importantly we'll talk about getting the job done on a daily basis so you can help your team be as awesome as possible.

You'll leave this session with some questions to ask of yourself, and some ideas on furthering your own leadership journey.

## <a name='leadership101Workshop'></a>Leadership 101

(Four hour workshop)

Have you worked for people you thought were great leaders, but weren't sure where they got that magic from? Have you seen people getting great results from their teams during difficult times and wanted to be able to get similar success with your own teams? Do you want to take on more responsibility in your career, but aren't sure how to get those opportunities? Leadership 101 will help you answer some of those questions! 

Join Jim Holmes in this highly interactive workshop where you'll learn some fundamental skills and gather some tools that can help you on your leadership journey. You'll clarify what makes an effective leader, learn a few critical communication skills, and get tips on dealing with difficult people and situations. 

You'll leave this workshop with a better understanding of leveraging your strengths and mitigating your weaknesses. You'll also take away approaches for ensuring you're able to best empower your teams to do amazing things.

## <a name='why'></a>Why?

Why? We don't ask it enough. We don't ask it enough of our politicians. We don't ask it enough of our colleagues. We certainly don't ask it enough of ourselves.

Take some time during this session to explore how thoughtfully and respectfully pushing back on accepted norms in software delivery can help you deliver much better value to your customers. We'll look into how you can explore why your processes seem so convuluted. We'll question why your meetings might be smothering your productivity. We'll look at why your engineering/craftsmanship/phrase-du-jour approaches to writing code might be killing your quality--and sanity.

We'll also look at ways you can work at injecting some much-needed change into your organization in order to address some of those "why" issues.

Sorry, we're not going to address anything about politicians. Handle that in your upcoming elections!

**Audience** Anyone

## <a name='omg'></a> "OMG! This Codebase Sucks!" Paying Down Technical Debt While Continuing to Deliver Value
 
Sure, you know you need to clean up the lousy codebase that's falling apart at the seams, but how are you going to figure out what to fix, how to fix it, who will fix it-and how you'll get that done while meeting the other commitments of continuing to deliver new value to your customers?

We'll discuss figuring out business's goals and priorities, then look to things like codebase metrics, defect rates, and source code churn in order to determine what areas of the codebase to work on.

Armed with that information, we'll talk about different ways to negotiate getting technical debt paid off while meeting your larger goals of continuing to ship value to your customers.

This talk won't cover best practices (BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ANY) nor will it attempt to convince you there are simple fixes to an unhealthy codebase. What you WILL leave with are ideas on how you can approach creating a strategy for your current situation.

> Version targeted to testing-ish conferences
> As testers we're often far too familiar with the pain of legacy codebases: extraordinarily brittle systems that explode with regressions after every release. We're also far too familiar with the fallout from those codebases: Upset stakeholders, frustrated support staff, and an angry horde of end users/customers&mdash;all of whom put the blame on the "quality assurance" group.

> We can help our teams and organizations start to heal up these codebases, but we have to do it in a fashion that acknowledges the business's need to continue shipping new value to the customers/users. After all, maintaining a revenue stream is great because it helps ensure we're getting paid!

## <a name='auto_all'></a> Let's Automate All 3,543 Manual Test Cases! Actually, Let's Not.

User interface functional tests are the Sirens of automated testing: seductive, alluring voices that draw you in only to die a horrible death as your ship breaks apart on murderous shoals.

UI automation is an incredibly hard, frustrating domain, and it's easy to get shipwrecked. In this talk you'll learn how to avoid breaking your team's motivation and will against those perilous shoals. Instead, you'll discover how to determine what to test by focusing on high-value use cases. You'll learn some of the many things you shouldn't be automating--and there are plenty! You'll also learn how to use your system itself to help speed up and bullet-proof your test suites.

This talk won't give you any best practices. Instead you'll learn life- and sanity-saving guidelines for keeping your UI tests as a valuable part of your team's successful delivery chain.

## <a name='ten_tips'></a> Ten Practical Tips for Automated Testing of Web Applications

60 minutes, ten takeaways for making solid functional User Interface tests of web applications. In this session we'll quickly cover the fundamentals of how automated web functional tests work, then dive into practical solutions you'll be able use on a daily basis. You'll see how to create maintainable tests using the Page Object Pattern, handle complex asynchronous (timing!) situations, and deal with common controls like complex grids, trees, calendars, and a number of other "interesting" automation scenarios.

You'll leave this session armed with knowledge you can immediately apply to make your automated functional tests faster, more maintainable, and easier to write!

## <a name='not_about_you'></a> It's Not About You
Why is it acceptable to have such horrible communication skills with those outside our cloistered group of technogeeks? Reality check: it's not acceptable. Our industry has a well-deserved reputation for poor communication with anyone who doesn't speak our language exactly, or those who are outside our little cliques. We routinely denigrate and ostracize folks who don't look or act like us, and we regularly insult or condescend to our stakeholders while forgetting they're the ones signing the checks-and who may have put their entire careers on the line for the projects we're running.

In this talk Jim lays out some clear rationale and approaches around creating better communication with our clients, teammates, and audiences. It all starts with the fundamental concept that good communication isn't centered around you the speaker, it has to be focused on who you're communicating to.
Good communication is about them, it's not about you.

**Audience:** Any

Note: This talk is best suited for shorter sessions such as 10-20 minute lightning talks, etc.

## <a name=''></a> It IS About You

Grace Slick once said she couldn't use her daughter as motivation for breaking her various drug addictions-Slick knew motivation for important things has to focus on the within, otherwise you risk falling apart if the other person ever lets you down. It's too easy an excuse: "She let me down so I'm going to go shoot up now." 

This talk's meant to help you figure out when to focus on YOU, not in the narcissistic or self-promotion sense, but from an empowered, humble stance that helps you set and achieve goals that are important to YOU. You need to focus on YOU for your career path. You need to focus on YOU for an empowered, productive work environment. You need to focus on YOU for your life.

Sometimes it *IS* about YOU.

NOTE: This talk is a 20 minute lightning talk.

## <a name='sounds_great'></a> That Sounds Great in Practice, But.

This talk doesn't even pretend to give you simplistic answers on how to effect change in your organization; however, you will learn some practical tips on how to start making that change happen. We'll discuss forming a clear vision for the change you want to implement, refining that vision, getting stakeholders on board, and dealing with forces resisting change. You'll also learn critical concepts like clarifying your idea, speaking the right language, creating a good pitch, and figuring out who owns the money you'll need for your idea.

Some of the real world examples you'll hear include working to set expectations, getting appropriate hardware and software for testing environments, dealing with offshore/outsourced contractors, and creating an organization-wide culture that cares about quality.

You'll leave this session with ideas based on Jim's successes - and you'll have learned from his frank discussions on where he's failed.

## <a name=''></a> Four Crucial Tips for Automating Your Web Tests
 
Functional testing your web applications can be extraordinarily frustrating. Intermittent failures, lots of rework and tinkering, and too little time spent on creating new value for your customers.
In this session Jim Holmes will help you understand a few crucial tips to help you get a successful web automation test suite in place: test the right things, understand good locators, handle asynchronous operations properly, and create a backing infrastructure to help you write better tests.
We'll use WebDriver for examples and demos in C#, but we'll discuss how these solutions are applicable to other technologies as well. Take away proven methods for ensuring your functional web tests are more robust, accurate, and maintainable.

## <a name='whyuno'></a> Why U No Test Yur UI?
 
Developers and testers with thousands of smoothly running unit tests have been known to run screaming like little kids away from user interface tests. While those geeks are cowering in terror under the bed (when has that ever worked in the movies?) instead of writing functional or UI tests, significant portions of your application are going unchecked.

What's the source of all this fear, and can teams learn to overcome it and learn some basic concepts to create stable, low-friction, valuable tests around their user interfaces? Of course they can, otherwise this session would be pointless.

Attendees will learn the two major areas of grief for UI testing: locators and dynamic (asynchronous) content/controls. You'll learn the fundamentals of both those problem areas and practical approaches for overcoming their challenges. You'll take away tips for great UI tests which you'll be able to apply at your work the next day.

Once you get out from under the bed, that is.

## <a name='dont_fear'></a> Don't Fear Automated Testing

This session is aimed at the non-technical tester, or at least the not-technical enough tester.  It will also be of value if you are a 'technical' tester but are confused around differing definitions for terms like "integration test.'
  
In either case, this talk is for you.
 
In this presentation you'll learn definitions of unit, integration, and functional tests. You'll see demonstrations of each type of test, and you'll also discover what concepts like continuous integration mean, and how they dramatically impact your project's overall quality. You'll learn why a mix of automated tests is critical to shipping high-quality software. You'll also learn why automation is not the SOLE piece of the testing puzzle, and why manual testing is still extraordinarily important! You'll see what unit, integration, and functional tests look like - yes, actual software code! You'll discover how pairing up with developers to provide feedback can result in dramatically improved test coverage - even though you don't know how to write code.

You'll learn a bit about different automated test types, and you'll also see how several different tools, frameworks, and APIs are used. (You'll even learn what API means!)

You'll leave this session with a better understanding of how your testing expertise can add to your project's overall quality, even in the mysterious realm of test automation!

**Audience:** 100 - 200

## <a name='collab'></a> Developer/Tester Collaboration: The Practical Side
 
This talk shows attendees practical places where testers and developers can (and should be!) collaborating more frequently: creating better test cases, bringing software engineering fundamentals to automated tests, creating testable systems, and more. 

The talk is focused primarily around creating automated test suites; however, overall testing runs through the talk as a secondary theme. How could it be otherwise?!

Developers will learn how working more closely with a tester can help them get better coverage in unit and integration testing. They'll also see how they can help testers write much better functional tests via slight modifications to their applications' user interfaces.

Testers will see how developers can help them create simpler functional test suites by learning software design concepts like Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) and Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

All attendees will leave this session with a better understanding of how effective collaboration between testers and developers can dramatically boost the final quality and suitability of your delivered systems.

## <a name='zero_eight'></a> Zero to Eight. Lessons Learned Starting a Test  Team from Scratch.

How do you build a successful suite of automated tests for your system? One test at a time, with lots of careful thought and a willingness to backtrack and adjust. In this talk Jim shares his experiences building up a test automation effort for a five year old legacy software product that had zero planned testing, manual or automated, prior to his taking on a job as a tester. 

You'll learn approaches for getting your own test automation effort in place, including making the case for automation, planning out infrastructure needs, and identifying tools to use for your automation. 
You'll also learn how to build up a team to be successful with automation, and you'll also discover why it's so critical to treat test automation as a software engineering effort - BECAUSE IT IS ONE! 

Explore how to deal with fundamental problems common to any automation effort: managing expectations, dealing with technical challenges, and empowering your testers via education. We'll also discuss the number one factor for failure or success: the organization's culture toward quality. This session focuses on one specific team's experience, but draws from Jim's years of experience in the field. You'll take away practical advice on what works, what doesn't, and some frank discussion around areas where Jim's failed with his teams in the past - and ideas on how to avoid those problems in your own automation efforts!

## <a name=''></a> Surviving Growing from Zero to 15,000 Selenium Tests

Selenium's a wonderful tool for automating acceptance and functional tests; however, real-world implementations bring a lot of pain. I suffered all that pain, and more, as I piloted an effort that started out with Selenium IDE, moved through RC, and ended up with WebDriver. This talk covers things like setting up baseline data, creating backing test frameworks, dealing with brittle tests, and figuring out how to appropriately manage all those incredibly slow Selenium tests so that you actually get effective, useful testing in. Learn from my pain (and successes!) so that you don't have to suffer it in your own projects!

Note: while this talk focuses on Selenium, many of the principles apply to an functional test tool, and can even be applied to other types of test suites including unit and integration.

**Audience:** 100 - 200

## <a name=''></a> Test Automation Isn't All Shiny Toys

Building a suite of automated tests for your project is a critical aspect of success-it can also be a contributor to your project's failure if you don't approach testing with the same care you take with the system you're delivering. This talk covers fundamental topics including setting up the right infrastructure, treating your test code the same as your production code, dealing with maintainability issues, and handling long-running test suites. We also cover why collaborating with developers can get you great benefits such as backing APIs and assistance with good test design.

We'll also cover more advanced topics such as wrapping combinatorial or pairwise approaches to help you cut your testability matrices while still keeping great coverage.

The talk is targeted primarily at functional tests; however, we'll also discuss how the same concepts apply to integration and unit tests. The talk is also tool-agnostic: we'll discuss Selenium, Watir, MS Web Test, and Telerik's Test Studio.

You'll leave this talk having learned practical, proven ways to avoid common automation pitfalls. This talk is based on my years of work with automation teams on a number of different platforms, plus discussing shared pain, failures, and successes with others passionate about the value automation brings to every software project.

**Audience:** 100 - 200

## <a name='test_webdriver'></a> Testing Your Web Applications With WebDriver (Workshop)
 
This workshop lays out the fundamentals of working with automated functional testing. We'll start with discussing how important clear acceptance criteria are, then do practical implementations of functional tests dealing with common situations such as input validation, AJAX delays, and working with file downloads.

Along the way you'll pick up critical concepts like dealing with a web page's DOM, element locators, and tools to help you interact with these. You'll also learn UI automation programming concepts like the Page Object Pattern, implicit and explicit waits, and modularizing your tests.
 
You'll also learn why testing at the UI isn't enough-and you'll learn how to build helper APIs to handle true testing heuristics as part of your tests.
Additionally, you'll see where you need to work together with developers to create a system that's more easily testable. We'll walk through simple changes you can make to your UI, and we'll look at how turning off features like CAPTCHA can ease your testing woes and dramatically decrease your scotch consumption.

This session focuses primarily on automating web tests, but many of the same concepts can be applied to other UI environments too. Demos and labs will be in C# and Ruby using WebDriver, but we'll also discuss other free and commercial tools like Watir, Telerik's Test Studio, and Visual Studio's CodedUI. 
You'll leave this session having learned how to deal with writing high-value functional tests using WebDriver. You'll also learn critical factors for success in keeping your tests running quickly, and avoiding brittle tests that break frequently.

NOTE: This session can be either a one hour breakout session or a half-day practical hands-on workshop.

**Audience:** 100 - 200


## <a name='three_tips'></a> 3 Tips to Improve Your Development Process

It doesn't matter if you're doing Agile or if you're working in an environment like RUP or CMMI, there are several things you can do to improve your development process.  This highly interactive session will show you three specific tips: improve your estimation, use a daily standup to keep a close focus on your progress, and work in retrospectives to empower your team's ability to drastically improve your entire software development process, regardless of what that process is, even if it's no process! You'll leave this session with a handle on ways to smooth out your project's environment.

**Audience:** 200

Feedback:
"Jim really hit the points home as to what we need to improve our processes in general. The best quote that I got from this talk was `It's estimation, not exactimation.'" Sarah Dutkiewicz,  http://is.gd/2ouuW

## <a name='distrib'></a> Making Distributed Teams Work (Effectively, Even!)

Working with distributed teams can cause extreme frustration, slower velocity for releases, and outright failures of successful completion of your projects - but it doesn't have to be this way! Distributed teams can help you bring great value to your customers, but you'll need a much different approach and mindset to make your teams work effectively.

This session will walk you through critical aspects of effective distributed teams including forming your team, tools for effective communication, smoothing your workflow, and dealing with conflict. Along the way you'll pick up practical tips and tricks learned by Jim during years of working with teams spread across the globe.

( Psst! Many of these topics covered in this talk work great for co-located teams, too!)

**Audience:** 100 - 200

## <a name=''></a> Introduction to Unit Testing
Unit testing can save you time, money, and frustration by helping you create a safety net around your software to guarantee its stability and quality. 

This introductory session is nearly all code and sets aside any testing methodologies such as Test or Behavioral Driven Development. Instead, you'll discover the fundamentals of what unit tests are, how to write them, and some differences between the most popular unit test frameworks. You'll also learn about organizing tests, creating test hierarchies, and heading off painful or brittle tests. You'll also learn how to isolate dependencies using stubs, fakes, and mocks. You'll leave this session with an understanding of how to get started writing unit tests.

Examples are in C# using NUnit and JustMock; however, the fundamentals apply to nearly every testing platform in most languages.

**Audience:** 100 - 200

Learn how to fend off the Mongol hordes by gaining an understanding of the basic fundamentals of software security, including public/private key encryption, threat modeling, and the importance of security education.  

Learn about some of the problems unique to managed environments such as Java or .NET, and find out what buffer overflows are and find out why leaving your system open to SQL injection can really ruin your sleep with a phone call from your boss at 2am.  More importantly, learn how to avoid these all-too-common errors.  This session will give you the foundation for understanding how to develop secure software.  Examples in C#, Java, and a few other things thrown in if time allows.

## <a name=''></a> Improve Your Testing With Open Source Test Tools

Solid testing is vital to any development effort if you want stable software that does what the customer expects the software to do.  Visual Studio Team Systems' testing functionality is powerful, but it's not the end-all for every testing task.  

Open source tools can help you get more out of your testing by enabling you to offload acceptance tests to your customers, simulate services you don't have access to, debug tests in Visual Studio's IDE, and automate ASP.NET web form testing.  A wealth of other tools allows you to speed up your test execution and get more information from your tests. Learn how tools such MbUnit, Rhino.Mocks, and Selenium can boost your testing accuracy and productivity.

## <a name=''></a> Real World Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007

The 2007 release of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) is an amazing platform for solving a great number of difficult problems for companies.  Workflow, Excel Services, enterprise search, forms services, and other tools provide a wealth of resources for businesses of all sizes.  

Unfortunately, the vast majority of complete-solution-in-15 minute examples are simplistic and don't fit the real world.  Find out what a real workflow looks like, and discover where InfoPath forms make sense and where they don't.  See how to quickly build packages to easily deploy your solutions across an entire SharePoint server farm.  

Most of all, discover that while MOSS does a great many things out of the box there's still room for developers to roll up their sleeves and do cool things in code.

## <a name=''></a> I Am MOSS Unit Tester (And So Can You!)
SharePoint is a powerful platform to develop on, but that doesn't get you around the need for solid testing as you build your software. Unit and integration testing are still critical pieces of creating great MOSS/WSS solutions for your clients, but unfortunately the industry isn't giving much guidance about how testing in SharePoint ought to work.  

This session will show you the basics of unit and integration testing and show how they apply to SharePoint.  We'll also discuss some of the yucky corners of SharePoint where testing may not make sense.
