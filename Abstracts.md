# Presentation Abstracts

My job as a speaker is to help you get great content for your user group, conference, training session, or whatever it is you're organizing. Below are abstracts for topics I have at hand, or have delivered in the past.

I'm happy to work with you if there's something you'd like me to talk about or train on, but don't see something that exactly fits.

## Workshops

### <a name='coding_noncoders'></a>Coding for Non-Coders

Are you part of a software delivery team, but don't know how to write or read software code? Many testers, business analysts, program managers, and other "non-technical" team members (what a bad label!) are often intimidated by their lack of coding ability. This has a direct impact on team effectiveness, as it impairs good communication in tasks as simple as Three Amigo discussions, or active coding events like pairing or mobbing.

Team members don't need to understand deep, technical aspects of software engineering to be effective contributers when coding. Everyone can make great inputs by understanding a few basics.

This workshop is intended to help team members gain basic comfort at writing software. Workshop attendees will NOT leave this course experts in software engineering. They WILL leave having written four to ten unit tests and the ssytem code to make those tests pass! 

The goal of this workshop is to learn and understand the most basic fundamentals of how works: source code, compilers, interpreters, Integrated Development Environments, and automated testing frameworks. Attendees will spend a bit of time learning basic concepts, discussing and clarifying a basic software example problem, then move straight into firing up an IDE and writing some code. Coding will be done as pairs or groups ("mobs"), so no attendee should feel intimidated about struggling alone!

The workshop will use Visual Studio Code and C#, and is supported for both Windows and Macintosh. Time permitting, examples of Java and Ruby may also be given.

**Takeaways**

* Learn enough about code and how it's written to have better conversations with your team
* Get basic exposure to fundamentals of software craftsmanship such as readability and simplicity
* Write some automated tests and the system code to make them pass!


**Audience:** Anyone

### <a name='speaker_workshop'></a>Learn to Become a Public Speaker

You. You right there. Yes, you! You have an amazing story inside you, and you're struggling on how to get that story out to others in your community&mdash;but you're scared and you don't know where to start.

This workshop will not teach you to be an international rockstar ninja keynote speaker. This workshop WILL teach you how to find your own authentic voice, and how to overcome your fears so you can get in front of a crowd and share what's important to you.

In this workshop you'll learn tips for refining that story of yours into a good concept. You'll walk through figuring out target audiences like user groups, meetups, conferences, or company lunch and learns. You'll get tips on figuring out your own presentation style, and how to build great slide decks that help you tell your story.

You'll also learn critical aspects of presenting talks including managing stage fright, effective movement on stage, controlling audience interaction, hooking your audience into your story, and handling follow up communications.

Learn how you can share that story that's bubbling inside you!

** Agenda: **

* Why do public speaking?
* Building the story (finding topic, clarifying, focusing)
* Finding a place to tell the story
* Working on abstracts and submitting
* Exercise/working groups
* Creating a great deck

**Audience:** Anyone


### <a name='test_webdriver'></a> Don't Let Your WebDriver Suite Drive You Crazy (Workshop)
Many teams are driven crazy by brittle, high-maintenance functional test suites. This workshop will help you understand how to create a flexible, maintainable, high-value suite of functional tests using Selenium Webdriver. You'll learn the basics of what to test, what not to test, and how to avoid overlapping with other types of testing.

This tutorial includes both philosophical concepts and hands-on coding. Testers who haven't written code shouldn't be intimidated! We'll pair you up in make sure you're successful.
 
You'll create practical tests dealing with situations such as input validation, AJAX delays, and working with file downloads.   

Additionally, you'll see where you need to work together with developers to create a system that's more easily testable. This session focuses primarily on automating web tests, but many of the same concepts can be applied to other UI environments too. 

Demos and labs will be in C# and Java using WebDriver. Some support for Python and Ruby is available if needed. 

You'll leave this session having learned how approaches to keep sane while writing high-value WebDriver tests.


NOTE: This session can be either a one hour breakout session or a half-day practical hands-on workshop.

**Key Takeaways**

* Automate high-value, high-risk workflows
* Don't duplicate tests that should be unit or integration
* Learn how to properly handle asynchronous actions
* Build custom APIs to make your tests simpler

**Audience:** 100 - 300

## Current Presentations

These talks are ones I've been giving regularly over the last couple years.

### <a name='you_got_this'></a>You Got This

[NOTE: Keynote at DevSpace 2018]

This is an intense talk covering mental health, depression, suicidal thoughts, and an extraordinary front-page headlines tragedy that ripped my family apart.

More importantly, this is a talk which discusses how strong and powerful we humans are when faced with soul-crushing trials. It's easy to lose sight of our abilities and strengths when we're fighting through incredibly hard times, but there are tools we can draw on to help us get through. Understanding concepts like Adriann Louw's work on pain, learning how to set boundaries, expressing grattitude, and above all learning to forgive ourselves are all crucial to dealing with hard times.

This isn't (just) a talk about Jim's experiences. It's a talk mean to help you learn to work through challenges you never thought you'd never be able to survive.


### <a name='backing_api'></a>Building a Custom Testing Framework

Custom frameworks are crucial for building a great automated test suite. They're especially crucial when you're trying to bring closer collaboration between your testers and developers. Custom frameworks help both roles focus on what they do best, while bring great speed and flexibility to your test suites.

In this session we'll walk through writing a custom framework that handles critical functions for any test suite, be it UI or integration. We'll write code that solves common problems, including:

* Creating random, unique data for a test
* Test data clean up
* Manage complex business rule interaction via Domain Objects
* Configure system capabilities, such as shutting off CAPTCHA
* Handling authentication

In passing we'll also discuss Page Objects and other crucial aspects of a well-designed, high-value, maintainable automated test suite.

Examples in C#, but the concepts apply to all stacks.

**Audience:** Intermediate

### <a name='techpaydown'></a> "Testers and Technical Debt"

Testers normally see only the more obvious consequences of technical debt: lots of regressions, confusing behavior, and slow delivery of work.

Testers can help drive significant organizational change. Why not use that superpower to help identify and pay down technical debt in your systems?

This talk will help testers learn specific steps to address technical debt by stepping back and looking at the systems' fit across the broader organziation, including

* Gathering data on tech debt impacts
* Helping reach organizational consensus on whether or not to address technical debt
* Weaving tech debt paydown work into regular feature work
* Changing culture and practices that created tech debt in the first place

**Takeaways**

* Learn to approach technical debt as a business/organizational issue, not just a technical one
* Learn to reach into broader areas of the organization such as customer service, sales, and executive sponsorship
* Learn how to pay down technical debt while continuing delivery of new value

### <a name='culture'></a>Experience Report: Changing Testing Culture in a Ginormous Company

How do you change culture, mindset, and skills in a global organization entrenched in practices that were outdated 20 years ago?

One small, frustrating step at a time.

In this talk I'll share my experiences working at a Fortune 10 company where I helped small teams of testers on three different continents dramatically change how they helped their projects deliver value to the company. I'll talk about dealing with people (NOT RESOURCES!), navigating ways through corporate bureaucracy and fifedoms, and most importantly how to get advocates at levels that can actually help you with change.

This talk will be full of abject failures we suffered, but also highlight some of the amazing changes we saw over a three year period.

### <a name='stronger'></a> ...Makes You Stronger

We've become a culture averse to adversity. From "no-losers" sports to "safe spaces" on campuses we make a conscious effort to avoid the pain that comes from defeat or hard-to-hear differences of philosophy and outlook. We take this same avoidance in to far more painful aspects of our own personal lives as well. Through this fear of confronting hard things we've lost sight that our humanity shines no brighter than when we push through struggles large and small.

Our muscles and endurance only grow when we push well in to discomfort and often outright pain. Our minds, psyches, and spirts need the same hard work as well. After all, what doesn't kill you...

### <a name='better_quality'></a>More Better Quality Coverage


How do you ensure your feature's well-built and does what the customer needs (which may be different than what they want)? How do you ensure the feature's high quality? When do you discuss things like test case construction? Test data creation? Performance needs? And let's just skip by security because that's scary.

In this session we'll walk through creating a critical business feature. We'll take the journey all the way from ideation through production monitoring. You'll learn where to have various conversations about quality, and what you might consider along the way.

You'll see examples of good conversations used to help business focus on high-value features. You'll also help build out solid acceptance criteria, and you'll learn where to tie those pesky "Non-functional requirements" in. We'll tie all this together with working tests and code--and you'll see how exploratory testing fits in along the entire journey.

Make sure you're getting the best quality coverage of your work!

### <a name='key_wb_tips'></a>Five Key Tips To Write Better WebDriver Scripts

Anyone can learn to write WebDriver scripts to help with automation and testing. Even team members with no coding experience can learn to help contribute value to their teams, and learn in fairly short order!

This session is targeted to help team members write WebDriver code that's accurate, understandable, and maintainable. Learning these tips will help you and your teams write stable WebDriver scripts that won't require constant tweaking and maintenance.

Attendees will see practical demonstrations of concepts including the Page Object Pattern, good Locator strategy, dealing with asynchronous actions, and writing custom APIs (also called "backing APIs") to help facilitate better testing.

Additionally, we'll discuss why it's so important to team testers up with software developers in order to get the best out of testable systems.

Examples will be in C#, but Ruby and Java will also be discussed&mdash;or any other platforms the attendees ask about.

### <a name='beyond_basics'></a> Automated Testing: Beyond The Basics

You've been through some initial training or bootstrapping. Now you're three to six months down the road and you're finding a lot of time is being spent chasing intermittent test failures. You're spending a lot of time maintaining your codebase. You're spending a lot of time dealing with frustration and trust in the automated tests. What's you're not doing is adding a lot of value around new feature work.

Sound familiar? It's a pattern that's common across nearly every team that is new to building significant automation suites. Jim Holmes helps you find a few approaches that may save your sanity&mdash;all based on years of experience and hard knocks. 

This isn't a WebDriver 101 session; we won't be covering basics like waits, find logic, or basic page objects. Instead, we'll dive in to solving problems using software craftsmanship principles, custom-designed APIs, and approaches like Selenium Grid to help you scale out your test suites via parallel execution. You'll leave the session with practical tips to apply to your own testing.

**Key Takeaways**

* Avoid overlap of unit, integration, and functional tests
* Test code **is** production code. Treat it as such.
* Build custom APIs wrapping system APIs to facilitate testing
* Parallelization is a last step for speed, not the first

### <a name='growing_testing'></a> Growing a Testing^H^H^H^H^H^H^HWhole Team Organization The Hard Way

Organizational change doesn't come easy. We humans are tetchy beings who often aren't comfortable getting out of the comfy ruts we let ourselves get in.

Join Jim Holmes for an experience report on how he helped a couple organizations change how they tested and delivered software. You'll learn some critical techniques for helping drive change around testing: Getting buy-in from executives and management. Hiring/staffing the right people. Helping existing team members learn to adapt--and dealing with those that won't. 

You'll also learn why testing tools and test cases do NOT solve any quality issues, and you'll also hear plenty of lessons-learned and hard knocks.

Stovepiped testing should have gone down with the Titanic. Learn how to help your organization get quality across your entire delivery team, not just the people you blame for not "Assuring Quality."

### <a name='it_team_leadership'></a> How Do I Lead an IT Team and Not Go Crazy?

Few organizations do a good job helping their workers grow into leadership positions. It's even worse in the IT realm where we seem to cherish attitudes of introversion, poor communication skills, and a lack of understanding business principles.

This session helps attendees understand questions they can ask of themselves as they move into roles leading software delivery teams such as: What does my organization expect of me? How do I learn to priortize effectively? How do I lead people in technical areas I don't know? Do I even want to do this?

Attendees will leave this session with practical ideas based on Jim's decades of leadership experience.

**Key Takeaways**

* Learn to communicate in business, not technical lanquage
* Educate your team to think outside the technical domain
* Create an environment safe to fail in
* Identify your weaknesses, learn to mitigate (not hide!) them

### <a name='growing_leadership'></a> Growing Into Leadership

Too many of our organizations across society have poor leadership. It doesn't matter if we're talking about the military, private sector firms, or the local Cub Scout pack. Great leaders help us get the most out of our teams and ourselves, not just at the high meta level, but during each day's grind.

In this session we'll talk about why you might consider stepping up into a leadership role (or evolving one you're currently in), and what things about yourself you can leverage and improve upon. It's also important to understand routes you can take to leadership. Most importantly we'll talk about getting the job done on a daily basis so you can help your team be as awesome as possible.

You'll leave this session with some questions to ask of yourself, and some ideas on furthering your own leadership journey.

### <a name='why'></a>Why?

[Note: This was delivered as a Keynote at ISTACon 2015 in Sofia, Bulgaria. [Video of the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=uFjdSqDPLSQ)

Why? We don't ask it enough. We don't ask it enough of our politicians. We don't ask it enough of our colleagues. We certainly don't ask it enough of ourselves.

Take some time during this session to explore how thoughtfully and respectfully pushing back on accepted norms in software delivery can help you deliver much better value to your customers. We'll look into how you can explore why your processes seem so convuluted. We'll question why your meetings might be smothering your productivity. We'll look at why your engineering/craftsmanship/phrase-du-jour approaches to writing code might be killing your quality--and sanity.

We'll also look at ways you can work at injecting some much-needed change into your organization in order to address some of those "why" issues.

Sorry, we're not going to address anything about politicians. Handle that in your upcoming elections!

### <a name='omg'></a> "OMG! This Codebase Sucks!" Paying Down Technical Debt While Continuing to Deliver Value
 
Sure, you know you need to clean up the lousy codebase that's falling apart at the seams, but how are you going to figure out what to fix, how to fix it, who will fix it-and how you'll get that done while meeting the other commitments of continuing to deliver new value to your customers?

We'll discuss figuring out business's goals and priorities, then look to things like codebase metrics, defect rates, and source code churn in order to determine what areas of the codebase to work on.

Armed with that information, we'll talk about different ways to negotiate getting technical debt paid off while meeting your larger goals of continuing to ship value to your customers.

This talk won't cover best practices (BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ANY) nor will it attempt to convince you there are simple fixes to an unhealthy codebase. What you WILL leave with are ideas on how you can approach creating a strategy for your current situation.

> Version targeted to testing-ish conferences
> As testers we're often far too familiar with the pain of legacy codebases: extraordinarily brittle systems that explode with regressions after every release. We're also far too familiar with the fallout from those codebases: Upset stakeholders, frustrated support staff, and an angry horde of end users/customers&mdash;all of whom put the blame on the "quality assurance" group.

> We can help our teams and organizations start to heal up these codebases, but we have to do it in a fashion that acknowledges the business's need to continue shipping new value to the customers/users. After all, maintaining a revenue stream is great because it helps ensure we're getting paid!

### <a name='auto_all'></a> Let's Automate All 3,543 Manual Test Cases! Actually, Let's Not.

User interface functional tests are the Sirens of automated testing: seductive, alluring voices that draw you in only to die a horrible death as your ship breaks apart on murderous shoals.

UI automation is an incredibly hard, frustrating domain, and it's easy to get shipwrecked. In this talk you'll learn how to avoid breaking your team's motivation and will against those perilous shoals. Instead, you'll discover how to determine what to test by focusing on high-value use cases. You'll learn some of the many things you shouldn't be automating--and there are plenty! You'll also learn how to use your system itself to help speed up and bullet-proof your test suites.

This talk won't give you any best practices. Instead you'll learn life- and sanity-saving guidelines for keeping your UI tests as a valuable part of your team's successful delivery chain.

### <a name='ten_tips'></a> Ten Practical Tips for Automated Testing of Web Applications

60 minutes, ten takeaways for making solid functional User Interface tests of web applications. In this session we'll quickly cover the fundamentals of how automated web functional tests work, then dive into practical solutions you'll be able use on a daily basis. You'll see how to create maintainable tests using the Page Object Pattern, handle complex asynchronous (timing!) situations, and deal with common controls like complex grids, trees, calendars, and a number of other "interesting" automation scenarios.

You'll leave this session armed with knowledge you can immediately apply to make your automated functional tests faster, more maintainable, and easier to write!

### <a name='not_about_you'></a> It's Not About You
Why is it acceptable to have such horrible communication skills with those outside our cloistered group of technogeeks? Reality check: it's not acceptable. Our industry has a well-deserved reputation for poor communication with anyone who doesn't speak our language exactly, or those who are outside our little cliques. We routinely denigrate and ostracize folks who don't look or act like us, and we regularly insult or condescend to our stakeholders while forgetting they're the ones signing the checks-and who may have put their entire careers on the line for the projects we're running.

In this talk Jim lays out some clear rationale and approaches around creating better communication with our clients, teammates, and audiences. It all starts with the fundamental concept that good communication isn't centered around you the speaker, it has to be focused on who you're communicating to.
Good communication is about them, it's not about you.

**Audience:** Any

Note: This talk is best suited for shorter sessions such as 10-20 minute lightning talks, etc.

### <a name=''></a> It IS About You

Grace Slick once said she couldn't use her daughter as motivation for breaking her various drug addictions-Slick knew motivation for important things has to focus on the within, otherwise you risk falling apart if the other person ever lets you down. It's too easy an excuse: "She let me down so I'm going to go shoot up now." 

This talk's meant to help you figure out when to focus on YOU, not in the narcissistic or self-promotion sense, but from an empowered, humble stance that helps you set and achieve goals that are important to YOU. You need to focus on YOU for your career path. You need to focus on YOU for an empowered, productive work environment. You need to focus on YOU for your life.

Sometimes it *IS* about YOU.

NOTE: This talk is a 20 minute lightning talk.

### <a name='sounds_great'></a> That Sounds Great in Practice, But.

This talk doesn't even pretend to give you simplistic answers on how to effect change in your organization; however, you will learn some practical tips on how to start making that change happen. We'll discuss forming a clear vision for the change you want to implement, refining that vision, getting stakeholders on board, and dealing with forces resisting change. You'll also learn critical concepts like clarifying your idea, speaking the right language, creating a good pitch, and figuring out who owns the money you'll need for your idea.

Some of the real world examples you'll hear include working to set expectations, getting appropriate hardware and software for testing environments, dealing with offshore/outsourced contractors, and creating an organization-wide culture that cares about quality.

You'll leave this session with ideas based on Jim's successes - and you'll have learned from his frank discussions on where he's failed.

### <a name=''></a> Four Crucial Tips for Automating Your Web Tests
 
Functional testing your web applications can be extraordinarily frustrating. Intermittent failures, lots of rework and tinkering, and too little time spent on creating new value for your customers.
In this session Jim Holmes will help you understand a few crucial tips to help you get a successful web automation test suite in place: test the right things, understand good locators, handle asynchronous operations properly, and create a backing infrastructure to help you write better tests.
We'll use WebDriver for examples and demos in C#, but we'll discuss how these solutions are applicable to other technologies as well. Take away proven methods for ensuring your functional web tests are more robust, accurate, and maintainable.
**Audience:** 200

### <a name='whyuno'></a> Why U No Test Yur UI?
 
Developers and testers with thousands of smoothly running unit tests have been known to run screaming like little kids away from user interface tests. While those geeks are cowering in terror under the bed (when has that ever worked in the movies?) instead of writing functional or UI tests, significant portions of your application are going unchecked.

What's the source of all this fear, and can teams learn to overcome it and learn some basic concepts to create stable, low-friction, valuable tests around their user interfaces? Of course they can, otherwise this session would be pointless.

Attendees will learn the two major areas of grief for UI testing: locators and dynamic (asynchronous) content/controls. You'll learn the fundamentals of both those problem areas and practical approaches for overcoming their challenges. You'll take away tips for great UI tests which you'll be able to apply at your work the next day.

Once you get out from under the bed, that is.

**Audience:** 200

### <a name='dont_fear'></a> Don't Fear Automated Testing

This session is aimed at the non-technical tester, or at least the not-technical enough tester.  It will also be of value if you are a 'technical' tester but are confused around differing definitions for terms like "integration test.'
  
In either case, this talk is for you.
 
In this presentation you'll learn definitions of unit, integration, and functional tests. You'll see demonstrations of each type of test, and you'll also discover what concepts like continuous integration mean, and how they dramatically impact your project's overall quality. You'll learn why a mix of automated tests is critical to shipping high-quality software. You'll also learn why automation is not the SOLE piece of the testing puzzle, and why manual testing is still extraordinarily important! You'll see what unit, integration, and functional tests look like - yes, actual software code! You'll discover how pairing up with developers to provide feedback can result in dramatically improved test coverage - even though you don't know how to write code.

You'll learn a bit about different automated test types, and you'll also see how several different tools, frameworks, and APIs are used. (You'll even learn what API means!)

You'll leave this session with a better understanding of how your testing expertise can add to your project's overall quality, even in the mysterious realm of test automation!

**Audience:** 100 - 200

### <a name='collab'></a> Developer/Tester Collaboration: The Practical Side
 
This talk shows attendees practical places where testers and developers can (and should be!) collaborating more frequently: creating better test cases, bringing software engineering fundamentals to automated tests, creating testable systems, and more. 

The talk is focused primarily around creating automated test suites; however, overall testing runs through the talk as a secondary theme. How could it be otherwise?!

Developers will learn how working more closely with a tester can help them get better coverage in unit and integration testing. They'll also see how they can help testers write much better functional tests via slight modifications to their applications' user interfaces.

Testers will see how developers can help them create simpler functional test suites by learning software design concepts like Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) and Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

### <a name='zero_eight'></a> Zero to Eight. Lessons Learned Starting a Test  Team from Scratch.

How do you build a successful suite of automated tests for your system? One test at a time, with lots of careful thought and a willingness to backtrack and adjust. In this talk Jim shares his experiences building up a test automation effort for a five year old legacy software product that had zero planned testing, manual or automated, prior to his taking on a job as a tester. 

You'll learn approaches for getting your own test automation effort in place, including making the case for automation, planning out infrastructure needs, and identifying tools to use for your automation. 
You'll also learn how to build up a team to be successful with automation, and you'll also discover why it's so critical to treat test automation as a software engineering effort - BECAUSE IT IS ONE! 

Explore how to deal with fundamental problems common to any automation effort: managing expectations, dealing with technical challenges, and empowering your testers via education. We'll also discuss the number one factor for failure or success: the organization's culture toward quality. This session focuses on one specific team's experience, but draws from Jim's years of experience in the field. You'll take away practical advice on what works, what doesn't, and some frank discussion around areas where Jim's failed with his teams in the past - and ideas on how to avoid those problems in your own automation efforts!

### <a name=''></a> Surviving Growing from Zero to 15,000 Selenium Tests

Selenium's a wonderful tool for automating acceptance and functional tests; however, real-world implementations bring a lot of pain. I suffered all that pain, and more, as I piloted an effort that started out with Selenium IDE, moved through RC, and ended up with WebDriver. This talk covers things like setting up baseline data, creating backing test frameworks, dealing with brittle tests, and figuring out how to appropriately manage all those incredibly slow Selenium tests so that you actually get effective, useful testing in. Learn from my pain (and successes!) so that you don't have to suffer it in your own projects!

Note: while this talk focuses on Selenium, many of the principles apply to an functional test tool, and can even be applied to other types of test suites including unit and integration.

**Audience:** 100 - 200

### <a name=''></a> Test Automation Isn't All Shiny Toys

Building a suite of automated tests for your project is a critical aspect of success-it can also be a contributor to your project's failure if you don't approach testing with the same care you take with the system you're delivering. This talk covers fundamental topics including setting up the right infrastructure, treating your test code the same as your production code, dealing with maintainability issues, and handling long-running test suites. We also cover why collaborating with developers can get you great benefits such as backing APIs and assistance with good test design.

We'll also cover more advanced topics such as wrapping combinatorial or pairwise approaches to help you cut your testability matrices while still keeping great coverage.

The talk is targeted primarily at functional tests; however, we'll also discuss how the same concepts apply to integration and unit tests. The talk is also tool-agnostic: we'll discuss Selenium, Watir, MS Web Test, and Telerik's Test Studio.

You'll leave this talk having learned practical, proven ways to avoid common automation pitfalls. This talk is based on my years of work with automation teams on a number of different platforms, plus discussing shared pain, failures, and successes with others passionate about the value automation brings to every software project.
